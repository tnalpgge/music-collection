Random scripts related to managing a digital music collection

## vwTunes

Build an iPod-like filesystem on removable media.  Uses standard
format playlists to manage artists and albums.

The Volkswagen which I drove at the time of writing had a slot for
a removable media card, and I only had a tiny iPod, thus the name
of the software.  

This is in no way endorsed by either Apple or Volkswagen, nor is
there any attempt here to make money off of this.

Possibly obsolete.

## herd

Gather music files together from multiple directories, so they can
be later imported into some sort of music collection manager.
